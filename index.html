                <p>Hi Ari :), <br><br>
                Happy Valentines Day! Thanks for making me smile every day :). You're the nicest, silliest, most loving person I know and I'm so lucky to have you as my girlfriend and as my best friend. I can't give you a card in person, so I decided to make this silly webpage for you.  These are just a few of my favorite memories of us together.</p>

                <p>Going through the pictures we have together makes me smile.  Thanks for being my adventure buddy making the last 2 years so incredible. More specifically, thanks for taking me to cool food places. I hope we get to conquer every restaurant in Pittsburgh, and then the world.  I'm so glad you love fud just as much as I do.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, thanks for being there for me when I need you.  I know sometimes we can get frustrated with each other, but at the end of the day I know you're always there for me.  You've made my life so much more exciting and interesting.  Without you, I wouldn't know any rock music, wouldn't know any Disney movies (I still don't really know that many (fix this!!)), wouldn't have watched LOTR, wouldn't get post cards from anybody, wouldn't watch any TV shows, wouldn't know how to find good food, and would probably suck completely at cooking. These are just some of the many unquantifiable (is that the right word?) things you do to express your love to me, and I'm very grateful for everything that you do.</p>
